N8N — Agentic AI Learning Repo
Personal learning repository for the Agentic AI course at IIST (Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology) — organized by the college SIG (Special Interest Group).

👋 About
Hi, I'm Bhavesh, a student at IIST.
This repository is where I track everything I build and learn while studying n8n and Agentic AI workflows through my college SIG.

🗂️ Projects
Folder	Description
VScode_agent/	IIST Admissions portal (HTML/CSS/JS) with an embedded n8n chatbot powered by Google Gemini
🤖 What is n8n?
n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that lets you connect apps, APIs, and AI models with a visual node-based editor — no complex backend code required.

Key concepts I am learning:

Triggers — start a workflow (e.g. webhook, schedule, chat message)
AI Agent node — orchestrates reasoning and tool use
Chat models — connect LLMs like Google Gemini
Memory nodes — keep conversation context
Tool nodes — let the agent call APIs or read documents
🔁 n8n Agentic Flow (used in VScode_agent)

🛠️ Tech Stack
n8n — workflow automation & AI orchestration
Google Gemini — LLM for chat responses
HTML / CSS / JavaScript — front-end projects
n8n Chat Web SDK — embeddable chat widget
🚀 Getting Started
Clone this repo and explore individual project folders:

git clone https://github.com/aibhavesh/N8N.git
cd N8N
Each sub-folder has its own README.md with run instructions.

📌 Learning Goals
 Understand n8n workflow concepts (triggers, nodes, connections)
 Build AI agents with memory and external tools
 Integrate n8n chat widgets into web projects
 Automate real-world tasks using agentic AI pipelines
